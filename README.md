```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

4. Access the app in your web browser at the provided local URL (usually http://localhost:8501/).

## Features

- **User Input:** Enter patient data using sliders in the sidebar.
- **Data Overview:** View descriptive statistics of the training dataset.
- **Patient Data Display:** See the entered patient data.
- **Diabetes Prediction:** The model predicts whether the patient has diabetes or not.
- **Visualizations:** Explore multiple scatter plots to visualize the patient's data in relation to the training dataset and prediction outcome.
